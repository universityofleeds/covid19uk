### LIDA COVID19

There are two sets of data within this application. The main dataset comes directly from Public Health England and can be found [here](). The data is released as and when PHE feels fit but all historical releases can be found from their API's. This can also be found within the source code.

The world dataset comes from European Centre for Disease Control ECDC which can be found [here](). The data is consisted of daily releases of cases and death for countries around the world. The location on the map is generated from the latitude and longitude values provided within the dataset.

There has been no proprocessing, both code and data are open source and can be found on the GitHub repository linked.

The source code is a fork of Turing Geovisualization Engine (eAtlas).

The work was kickstarted by Prof Chris Gale (cordirector of LIDA). The development was carried out by Dr Layik Hama. Dr Nik Lomax, Dr Roger Beecham, Professor Mark Birkin, Martin Callaghan, David Joseph and many others have contributed to the development of this web app.
